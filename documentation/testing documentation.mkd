## Performance Tests

The algorithms were tested on three 6000x6000 mazes with simple patterns.

First was a straight line:

Second a spaced out checkerboard pattern:

The third a diagonal divide with a single gap:

The tests were ran 5 times and the results averaged.

### Results

* Test 1:
 * Dijkstra: 61 ms
 * A*: 26 ms
 * IDA*: 84 ms

* Test 2:
 * Dijkstra: 81 ms
 * A*: 27 ms
 * IDA*: 23 ms

* Test 3:
 * Dijkstra: 26 ms
 * A*: 88 ms
 * IDA*: 23 ms
